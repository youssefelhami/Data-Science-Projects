# My Data Science Projects

## Inroduction
Since most of my Data Science works have been implemented on Google Colabs, I was advised to upload my projects on a Github, so I created this repo. A few micro projects to try out certain ML implementations are included as well.

## Projects

A better description of each project is in their respective read.me file

### Projects Included

- Book Scrapping and EDA

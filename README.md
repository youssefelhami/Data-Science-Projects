# My Data Science Projects

## Inroduction
Since most of my Data Science works have been implemented on Google Colabs, I was advised to upload my projects on a Github, so I created this repo. A few micro projects to try out certain ML implementations are included as well.

## Projects

A better description of each project is in their respective read.me file

### Projects Included

- [**Music Genre Classification:**](https://github.com/youssefelhami/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/Music%20Genre%20Classification) Multiclass real world problem to classifiy the music genre from the MFCC extracted from a 30 second clip. The model was implemented using LSTM.
	-	**Dataset** [GTZAN Dataset - Music Genre Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification)
	-	**Tools:** Tensorflow, Keras, Librosa, Numpy, Pandas

- [**Traffic Sign Classification:**](https://github.com/youssefelhami/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/Traffic%20Sign%20Classification) Multiclass real world problem to classifiy the traffic sign from a photo. Model was implemented twice, once with a CNN made from scratch and another with a CNN based on VGG-16.
	-	**Dataset** [GTSRB - German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign)
	-	**Tools:** Tensorflow, Keras, Numpy, Pandas

- [**Laptop Price Predictor:**](https://github.com/youssefelhami/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/Laptop%20Price%20Predictor) Regression problem in field of technology by using the laptop brand, CPU, GPU, RAM and Storage to predict the price of a laptop. The data was loaded, its features were extacted, manipulated, and analyzed accordingly.
	-	**Dataset** Saved as a CSV file in the folder
	-	**Tools:** Sklearn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Numpy, Pandas

- [**Book Scrapping and EDA:**](https://github.com/youssefelhami/bookrepository-big-data-project) Mined book data from BookRepository and GoodReads, performed an extensive exploratory data analysis, and a sentiment analysis of the book reviews to determine if they are genre biased.
	-	**Dataset** Personally mined from [BookRepository](https://www.bookdepository.com/) and [GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/)
	-	**Tools:** Beautifulsoup, Hadoop, Hive, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Numpy, Pandas

- [**Book Recommendation System:**](https://github.com/youssefelhami/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/Book%20Recommendation%20System) finds books similar to a book selected from the title from the title, author, and summary, using the cosine similarity.
	-	**Dataset** [Goodreads Best Books Ever dataset](https://github.com/scostap/goodreads_bbe_dataset)
	-	**Tools:** SKlearn, NLTK, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Numpy, Pandas
